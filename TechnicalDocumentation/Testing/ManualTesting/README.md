# Manual Testing
Throughout all the projects lifecycle each feature and subsystem has undergone a series of methodical manual testing. [TestGame](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_allport_michael_s/-/blob/master/GameEngine/src/App/Tests/TestGame.h) class was created as a sandbox to create isolated test environments for each feature being implemented. Previous versions of the software under [versions](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301_2020/ce301_allport_michael_s/-/tree/master/TechnicalDocumentation/Introduction/Versions) can be found with such environments implemented and repeatable tests achieved. These classes made use of ImGui to provide very basic GUI interaction with the user, specifying parameters for functionality implemented or by merely rendering what was expected to screen.
