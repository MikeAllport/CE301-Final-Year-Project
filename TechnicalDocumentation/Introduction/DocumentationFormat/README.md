Towards the topmost level of Chapters 2 and 3 you can expect to find a high-level package diagram showing all responsible classes for a given section. With each level down, more detail and technical knowledge is provided. the final layer contains the direct implementations, method specific, and full class diagrams showing the interconnectedness of all the relates classes.
